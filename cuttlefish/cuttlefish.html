    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.

    <h2>Taxonomy and etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[4] is derived from the Old English name for the species,
        cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5]
        Over 120 species of cuttlefish are currently recognised, grouped into six families divided between two
        suborders. One suborder and three families are extinct.
